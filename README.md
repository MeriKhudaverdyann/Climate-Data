# Global Climate Data Analysis

## Project Overview
This project performs an in-depth analysis of global climate, agricultural, and environmental data to explore patterns and relationships across various climate indicators. The analysis utilizes Python for data processing, and visualization is carried out using Power BI and Jupyter Notebook. The main code and analyses are contained in the Jupyter Notebook file `climate_analysis.ipynb`.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project is `global_climate_data.csv` and includes extensive data from diverse locations worldwide, focusing on climate, environmental, and agricultural metrics.

### Dataset Details:
- **Number of records**: 28,731
- **Variables**: 51 columns, covering temperature, air quality, natural disaster frequency, agricultural factors, and geospatial data.
- **Geospatial Information**: Latitude, Longitude, etc.
- **Climate Variables**: Temperature, Humidity, Precipitation
- **Air Quality Measures**: PM2.5, PM10, CO, etc.
- **Natural Disasters**: Frequency and types of disasters
- **Sun and Moon Phases**: Including sunrise and sunset times.

## Analysis Highlights
This project includes multiple analyses to extract key insights from the data:

### 1. Climate and Air Quality Relationship
- **Temperature and Air Quality**: Analysis reveals notable correlations between temperature variations and air quality indicators like PM2.5 and CO.
- **Country-based Analysis**: Analyzed average temperatures and air quality index across various countries.

### 2. Seasonal Patterns and Trends
- **Monthly Temperature Variations**: Identified peaks in temperatures during specific months, especially during summer for many regions.
- **Disaster Frequency Analysis**: Analyzed the frequency and distribution of natural disasters globally and seasonally.

### 3. Principal Component Analysis (PCA)
- Conducted PCA on key climate variables to reduce dimensionality and highlight major patterns across data points.
- Visualizations of principal components provided insights into significant variability across climate variables.

### 4. Clustering Analysis
- **Optimal Cluster Identification**: Using the Elbow Method, determined the optimal number of clusters for K-means.
- **Cluster Insights**: Grouped locations based on climate profiles, revealing natural similarities in climate patterns among different regions.

## Recommendations
- **Environmental Policy**: Insights from temperature and air quality relationships can inform environmental protection policies.
- **Disaster Preparedness**: Seasonal disaster patterns could guide resource allocation for disaster management.
- **Agricultural Planning**: Understanding climate patterns aids in crop planning and risk assessment.

## Conclusion
This analysis offers valuable insights into global climate and environmental patterns, enabling data-driven decisions in areas like environmental policy, disaster readiness, and agricultural planning.
